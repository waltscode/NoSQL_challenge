# Social_Networking_API_NoSQL

Welcome to the Social Networking API using NoSQL Mongoose and Mongo Compass database GUI! This API is a demonstration of routing using express server technology to: 

- CREATE, UPDATE, and REMOVE users
- CREATE and REMOVE friends of users
- Users are able to CREATE, UPDATE, and REMOVE thoughts 
- Users are able to then CREATE and REMOVE reactions to other user's thoughts

- NOTE*** friends are sorted in an array associated with users 
- NOTE*** reactions are sorted in an array associated with thoughts
- BOTH are tallied up in a total using mongoose virtuals

ALL of these endpoints are able to be tested and proven in insomnia and video demonstration can be found in the README.md
